Delaypay was a project that I worked on with a group of two web dev's ( including me ), two graphic designers, and a content creator.
We had to make a website inspired by the works of Belgium artist Dries Depoorter. I gpt the change to speak to Dries in person, which
motivated me even more for the project. The idea that i came up with for the website was an online gambling site where you can bet money
on how long the delay on your train was. we eventually converted this idea into a mobile demo and a presentation. the code for the mobile 
demo is saved in this repository, the presentation however, remains lost in the chambers of the old imacs that i made them on. If you want
to chack out the demo itself, then i suggest you to pay a visit to delaypaymobile.vercel.app NOTE: the demo is completely in the dutch language,
and is designed for mobile phones.
( please note this is an old project and i didnt really know js )
